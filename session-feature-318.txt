### Feature #318: Workflow Import/Export ✅

**Status:** COMPLETED AND VERIFIED
**Category:** Workflow Automation
**Priority:** 349

**Implementation Summary:**

Added comprehensive workflow import/export functionality for backup and sharing:

**Backend Implementation:**

1. **Export Endpoint (GET /api/workflows/:id/export)**
   - Exports complete workflow definition as JSON
   - Includes: name, description, trigger, conditions, actions, version
   - Sets proper Content-Disposition header for file download
   - Format: {workflow_name}_workflow.json
   - Wrapper with version metadata and export timestamp

2. **Import Endpoint (POST /api/workflows/import)**
   - Imports workflow from JSON file
   - Validates workflow structure (name, triggerType, actions required)
   - Validates trigger type against allowed values
   - Validates actions array format
   - Handles name conflicts by appending timestamp
   - Supports importing as template (inactive flag)
   - Admin/Manager only (proper authorization)
   - Resets version to 1 for imported workflows

**Frontend Implementation:**

1. **Export Button**
   - Added to workflow actions in Workflows list page
   - Violet/purple color icon (download icon)
   - Loading state during export
   - Triggers file download via blob API
   - Success notification on completion

2. **Import Button & Modal**
   - Added "Import" button to header (next to "Create Workflow")
   - Modal with file picker (JSON files only)
   - Checkbox for "Import as Template" option
   - Shows selected file name
   - Form validation (file required)
   - Loading state during import
   - Auto-refreshes workflow list after import
   - Error handling with user-friendly messages

**Testing Completed:**

✅ **Export Test (Browser Automation):**
- Logged in as admin@test.com
- Navigated to Workflows page
- Clicked Export button on "Document Expiration Reminders (Copy)" workflow
- File downloaded successfully: "Document_Expiration_Reminders__Copy__workflow.json"
- Verified JSON structure contains all required fields
- Success notification displayed

**Feature Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Add export workflow button that downloads JSON file
- ✅ Add import workflow page/modal
- ✅ Validate imported workflow structure
- ✅ Create new workflow from imported data
- ✅ Handle template vs active workflow import
