Task Assignment Feature Implementation Summary:
==========================================

Feature Implemented: Task assignment workflow

What Was Built:
1. Backend: GET /api/users/team endpoint
   - Returns list of active team members
   - No admin access required (all authenticated users)
   - Returns: id, name, role for each user

2. Backend: Updated task creation/update endpoints
   - POST /api/tasks - accepts assignedToId parameter
   - PUT /api/tasks/:id - accepts assignedToId parameter
   - Already existed in codebase, now utilized

3. Frontend: Team members dropdown in task creation modal
   - 'Assign To (optional)' Select component
   - Fetches team members on component mount
   - Shows: 'Name (Role)' format
   - Clearable (can leave unassigned)

4. Frontend: Task display shows assignment
   - User icon + 'Assigned to: Name' below task text
   - Only shows when task has assignment
