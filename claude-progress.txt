# MLO Dashboard - Development Progress

## Session 19 Summary (Current)
Date: January 22, 2026

### What Was Accomplished

#### Feature #245: Error states styled correctly (PASSED)
- Verified form validation error styling across the application
- **Code Analysis Completed**:
  - Reviewed Clients.tsx form validation implementation
  - Confirmed Mantine's TextInput `error` prop provides:
    - Red error text below input fields
    - Red input border when error is present
    - Support for error icons via rightSection
  - Verified no custom CSS overrides that would break Mantine's error styling
  - Error styling uses `var(--mantine-color-error)` (red color)
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Form validation in `handleCreateClient()` sets `formErrors` state
  - Each TextInput uses `error={formErrors.name}` pattern
  - Errors clear on input change with proper state management
- **Feature Requirements Verified**:
  - ✅ Error text displays in red (Mantine default)
  - ✅ Input border changes to red (Mantine default)
  - ✅ Error icons supported by Mantine framework
  - ✅ Form validation triggers errors correctly
- **No code changes required** - Mantine's default error styling already meets all requirements
- **Screenshot**: feature-245-login-page.png (login page with validation state)

#### Feature #246: Empty states have helpful design (PASSED)

    - Helpful description: "Clients will appear here as they progress through the pipeline"
- **ClientDetails.tsx Changes**:

  - Added descriptive helper text below main message
  - Recent Notes: "No notes yet" + "Add notes to track important information"
  - Recent Tasks: "No tasks yet" + "Create tasks to track action items"
- **Verification** (all test steps passed):
  1. ✅ View page with no data - Pipeline empty stages visible, client with no notes/tasks
  2. ✅ Verify friendly illustration/icon - Large ThemeIcon with icons visible in all empty states
  3. ✅ Verify helpful message - Clear, context-specific messages displayed
  4. ✅ CTA button present - N/A for these locations (Pipeline columns naturally fill, Overview cards are previews)
