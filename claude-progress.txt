## Session 31 Summary (PARALLEL EXECUTION - Feature #81)
Date: January 22, 2026
Agent: Assigned to Feature #81 ONLY

### What Was Accomplished

#### Feature #81: File upload error for wrong type (PASSED) ✅
- **Implementation**: Complete file type validation to reject dangerous files
- **Backend Changes (documentRoutes.ts)**:
  - Added ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES constant with 16 permitted file types (PDF, images, documents)
  - Added DANGEROUS_EXTENSIONS constant with 17 blocked extensions (.exe, .bat, .cmd, .com, .scr, .pif, .vbs, .js, .jar, .app, .deb, .rpm, .dmg, .pkg, .sh, .ps1, .vb, .wsf)
  - Implemented multer fileFilter for validation before processing
  - Enhanced error handling in upload route with callback pattern
  - Returns specific error messages with lists of blocked and allowed types
  - Proper HTTP status codes (400 for validation errors)
  - Security-first: server-side validation is authoritative
- **Frontend Changes (ClientDetails.tsx)**:
  - Enhanced Dropzone onDrop handler with client-side extension validation
  - Improved onReject handler with specific error messages for different rejection reasons
  - Expanded accept prop to include all document MIME types (was only PDF/images)
  - Updated help text from "PDF or images" to "PDF, images, or documents"

2. ✅ Try to upload .exe file - Frontend validation catches immediately
3. ✅ Verify error message about file type - Shows "File Type Not Allowed" with dangerous types list
4. ✅ Verify upload is rejected - File is not added to selected files, upload not attempted
5. ✅ Verify helpful allowed types shown - Error message and help text list all permitted types

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Dual-layer validation: client-side for UX, server-side for security
- File extension check catches dangerous files regardless of MIME type
- MIME type validation provides additional layer of security
- Error messages are specific and actionable
- Lists both what's blocked (dangerous files) and what's allowed (PDF, images, documents)
- Helps users understand what files they can upload
- Prevents security risks from executable and script files

**Verification Results**:
- Extension Validation: 10/10 tests passed ✓
- MIME Type Validation: 10/10 tests passed ✓
