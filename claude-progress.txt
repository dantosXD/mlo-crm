# MLO Dashboard - Development Progress

## Session 29 Summary (PARALLEL EXECUTION - Feature #80)
Date: January 22, 2026
Agent: Assigned to Feature #80 ONLY

### What Was Accomplished

#### Feature #80: Duplicate email rejected on create (PASSED) ✅
- **Implementation**: Complete duplicate email detection and user-friendly error handling
- **Backend Changes**:
  - Added duplicate email check in POST /api/clients endpoint
  - Checks for existing client with same emailHash for current user
  - Returns 409 Conflict with specific message: "A client with this email address already exists"
- **Frontend Changes**:
  - Enhanced fetchWithErrorHandling to read error response body
  - Modified getApiErrorMessage to prioritize backend error messages
  - Error notifications now display specific backend messages instead of generic ones
  - User sees clear, actionable error: "A client with this email address already exists"

**All Test Steps Verified**:
1. ✅ Create client with email 'duplicate@test.com' - Successfully created
2. ✅ Try to create another client with same email - Rejected with 409 Conflict
3. ✅ Verify error message about duplicate - Message: "A client with this email address already exists"
4. ✅ Verify first client unaffected - Original client remained intact after duplicate attempt
5. ✅ Verify error is specific - Message clearly indicates duplicate email issue

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Backend checks emailHash (case-insensitive) before creating client
- Duplicate check is scoped to current user (createdById)
- 409 HTTP status code properly indicates conflict
- Frontend reads JSON error response and displays backend's message
- Error message is user-friendly and actionable
- No technical jargon exposed to end users
- First client remains completely unaffected by duplicate attempts
