### Feature Verification

#### Feature #269: Workflow Database Schema ✅
**Status:** VERIFIED PASSING
**Category:** Workflow Automation
**Priority:** 300

**Description:**
Create database tables for workflows, workflow executions, and execution logs with all required fields for the automation engine.

**Verification Results:**

All three database tables are properly implemented and in active use:

1. **Workflow Table** ✅
   - Fields verified: id, name, description, isActive, isTemplate, triggerType, triggerConfig, conditions, actions, version, createdById
   - 18 workflows exist in database
   - Multiple trigger types supported: CLIENT_CREATED, STATUS_CHANGED, DOCUMENT_UPLOADED, TASK_OVERDUE, etc.
   - Relations: executions → WorkflowExecution[], versions → WorkflowVersion[], createdBy → User

2. **WorkflowExecution Table** ✅
   - Fields verified: id, workflowId, clientId, status, triggerData, currentStep, startedAt, completedAt, errorMessage, logs, retryCount, maxRetries, lastRetryAt, nextRetryAt
   - 708+ executions in database (e.g., Task Escalation workflow has 708 executions)
   - Status values: PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELLED, PAUSED
   - Relations: workflow → Workflow, client → Client, executionLogs → WorkflowExecutionLog[]
   - Retry mechanism implemented with exponential backoff

3. **WorkflowExecutionLog Table** ✅
   - Fields verified: id, executionId, stepIndex, actionType, status, inputData, outputData, errorMessage, executedAt
   - Logs created for each workflow action execution
   - Action types logged: SEND_EMAIL, CREATE_TASK, UPDATE_CLIENT, SEND_NOTIFICATION, WAIT, etc.
   - Status tracking: SUCCESS, FAILED, SKIPPED
   - Relations: execution → WorkflowExecution with cascade delete

**Frontend Verification:**
- ✅ Workflows page displays all 18 workflows (http://localhost:5173/workflows)
- ✅ Workflow executions list shows 708 executions with pagination
- ✅ Execution details modal shows:
  * Workflow metadata (name, description, status)
  * Client information
  * Execution timestamps (started, completed, duration)
  * Trigger data (JSON with taskId, clientId, dueDate, etc.)
  * Execution logs per step (actionType, status)
  * Error messages when applicable

**Backend Verification:**
- ✅ API routes implemented:
  * GET /api/workflows - List workflows with filtering
  * GET /api/workflow-executions - List executions with pagination
  * GET /api/workflow-executions/:id - Get execution details with logs
  * POST /api/workflow-executions/:id/cancel - Cancel running execution
- ✅ Workflow executor service uses all three tables:
  * Creates Workflow records on trigger
  * Creates WorkflowExecution records when running
  * Creates WorkflowExecutionLog records for each action step
  * Implements retry logic with workflowExecution updates

**Database Schema Compliance:**
- ✅ All required fields present in all three tables
- ✅ Foreign key relationships properly defined
- ✅ Indexes on workflowId, executionId, executedAt for performance
- ✅ Cascade deletes configured for data integrity
- ✅ Prisma schema matches feature requirements exactly

**Conclusion:**
Feature #269 is COMPLETE and PASSING. The workflow database schema is fully implemented, integrated, and actively used by the workflow automation engine. All three tables (Workflow, WorkflowExecution, WorkflowExecutionLog) contain all required fields and are functioning correctly with real data.
