# MLO Dashboard - Development Progress

## Session 1 Summary (Initializer Agent)
Date: January 5, 2026

### What Was Accomplished

#### 1. Project Specification Created
- Created comprehensive `app_spec.txt` with:
  - Complete feature list (15 major modules)
  - Technology stack (React/TypeScript frontend, Express/PostgreSQL backend)
  - Data models and relationships
  - API endpoints specification
  - Security requirements
  - Performance requirements
  - UI/UX design requirements

#### 2. Feature Database Populated (250 Features)
- Created exactly 250 test features covering all 20 mandatory categories:
  - Security & Access Control: ~20 tests
  - Navigation Integrity: ~25 tests
  - Real Data Verification: ~30 tests
  - Workflow Completeness: ~20 tests
  - Error Handling: ~15 tests
  - UI-Backend Integration: ~20 tests
  - State & Persistence: ~10 tests
  - URL & Direct Access: ~10 tests
  - Double-Action & Idempotency: ~8 tests
  - Data Cleanup & Cascade: ~10 tests
  - Default & Reset: ~8 tests
  - Search & Filter Edge Cases: ~12 tests
  - Form Validation: ~15 tests
  - Feedback & Notification: ~10 tests
  - Responsive & Layout: ~10 tests
  - Accessibility: ~10 tests
  - Temporal & Timezone: ~8 tests
  - Concurrency & Race Conditions: ~8 tests
  - Export/Import: ~6 tests
  - Performance: ~5 tests

#### 3. Project Structure Created
- Root package.json with dev scripts
- Frontend structure:
  - React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
  - Mantine UI v7 for components
  - Zustand for state management
  - React Query for server state
  - React Router v6 for routing
  - Basic App.tsx with route placeholders
  - Entry point (main.tsx)
- Backend structure:
  - Express.js + TypeScript
  - Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
  - Complete database schema (schema.prisma)
  - Basic server entry point (index.ts)

#### 4. Development Environment Setup
- Created init.sh script that:
  - Checks Node.js version (20+)
  - Creates .env file with defaults
  - Installs dependencies
  - Sets up database
  - Provides startup instructions

#### 5. Git Repository Initialized
- Created .gitignore
- Made initial commit with all project files

### Current Status
- Features: 0/250 passing (0%)
- All features are pending implementation
- Project structure is ready for development

### Next Steps for Future Agents

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd frontend && npm install
   cd ../backend && npm install
   ```

2. **Start implementing features in priority order**
   - Use `feature_get_next` to get the next feature
   - Mark as `in_progress` immediately
   - Implement the feature
   - Test with browser automation
   - Mark as `passing` when verified

3. **Priority Order (recommended)**
   - Authentication (login/logout) - Features 1-20
   - Client CRUD operations - Features 21-50
   - Notes, Tasks, Documents - Features 50-100
   - Loan scenarios - Features 100-120
   - Dashboard and Pipeline - Features 120-160
   - UI polish and accessibility - Features 160-200
   - Edge cases and performance - Features 200-250

4. **Key Implementation Notes**
   - Use Mantine components exclusively
   - Implement PII encryption for client data
   - Use hash-based search for encrypted fields
   - All API responses must be real database data (NO MOCK DATA)
   - Test every feature through browser UI before marking passing

### Important Reminders

1. NEVER create mock data - all data must come from real database
2. NEVER modify feature descriptions or delete features
3. ONLY mark features as passing after browser verification
4. Test on multiple viewport sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
5. Check browser console for errors on every page
6. Commit frequently with descriptive messages
