# MLO Dashboard - Development Progress

## Session 23 Summary (Current)
Date: January 22, 2026

### What Was Accomplished

#### Critical Bug Fix: Duplicate Import in App.tsx
- **Regression Test Discovery**: Testing Feature #172 (Tab navigation) revealed critical syntax error
- **Bug**: Duplicate `useNavigate` import on lines 2 and 3 of App.tsx
- **Impact**: Caused 500 error breaking the entire application
- **Fix**: Removed standalone import, kept combined import with other react-router-dom exports
- **Commit**: 3a7337d - "fix: Remove duplicate useNavigate import in App.tsx"

#### Feature #48: Upload document via drag and drop (PASSED) ✅

- **All Test Steps Verified**:
  1. ✅ Navigate to client documents tab
  2. ✅ Drag a PDF file to upload area (simulated via file input)
  3. ✅ Upload progress indicator verified (loading state on button, XHR progress tracking)
  4. ✅ Document appears in list after upload
  5. ✅ File name is correct ('test document 48', 'test-document-48.pdf')
  6. ✅ Default status is 'Uploaded'
- **Implementation Details Verified**:
  - Mantine Dropzone component properly configured
  - Accepts PDF and images (max 50MB)
  - Auto-fills document name from filename (removes extension, replaces -/_ with spaces)
  - Shows loading spinner during upload (savingDocument state)
  - XHR progress tracking implemented (line 1805 in ClientDetails.tsx)

  - Success notification on completion
  - Document persists in database (verified with page refresh)
  - Delete functionality works correctly

## Session 22 Summary (PARALLEL EXECUTION)
Date: January 22, 2026
Agent: Assigned to Feature #20 ONLY

### What Was Accomplished

#### Feature #20: Session expires after inactivity (PASSED) ✅
- Implemented automatic session timeout after period of inactivity
- **Implementation Details:**
  1. Added inactivity timeout configuration
     - Environment variable: SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES (default: 15 minutes)
     - Frontend variable: VITE_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES
  2. Implemented inactivity tracking in authStore
     - Added `lastActivity` timestamp to track user activity
     - `updateLastActivity()` function resets timer on user interactions
     - `checkSessionTimeout()` function verifies if session expired
     - Persisted `lastActivity` in localStorage
  3. Added auto-logout timer in App.tsx
     - 30-second interval checks for session timeout
     - Tracks user activity: mousedown, keydown, scroll, touchstart
     - Auto-logout when inactivity exceeded
     - Used refs to prevent interval resets on re-renders
  4. Added session expiry notification
     - Orange notification: "Your session has expired due to inactivity. Please log in again."
     - Redirects to login after 5 seconds
- **Test Steps Completed:**
  1. ✅ Login successfully - Tested with admin@example.com
  2. ✅ Note current time - lastActivity timestamp stored in localStorage
  3. ✅ Wait for session timeout - Tested with 1-minute timeout (70+ seconds wait)
  4. ✅ Attempt to access protected route - Interval check every 30 seconds
  5. ✅ Verify redirect to login - Confirmed redirect to /login works
  6. ✅ Verify session expired message - Notification displayed before redirect
- **Technical Challenges Resolved:**
  - Issue: Interval was being reset on every component re-render
  - Solution: Used refs to store function references and only depended on SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES
  - Issue: Environment variable not loading from root .env
  - Solution: Created frontend/.env file and used import.meta.env
  - Issue: Logout function call caused immediate component unmount
  - Solution: Moved logout logic to useEffect and used refs for stable references
- **Screenshots:**
  - feature-20-step1-dashboard.png - Dashboard view
  - feature-20-step2-logged-in.png - Logged in state
  - feature-20-step3-logged-in-before-timeout.png - Before timeout
  - feature-20-step4-after-timeout.png - After redirect to login

### Files Modified This Session
